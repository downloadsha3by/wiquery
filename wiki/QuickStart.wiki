#summary This page describes how to start a project with WiQuery 1.0

= Introduction =

This tutorial will teach you how to install and use WiQuery 1.0 in 5 minutes, with a classic "Hello world" example.

== Tools ==

To begin this tutorial, you'll need the following components to be installed:
  * [http://maven.apache.org/download.html Maven 2.0.10] 
  * Java JDK1.5+

== Version of Wicket ==

WiQuery is built over the last Wicket version: Wicket 1.4-rc2 version

== Starting a Wicket project ==

First of all, we need to start a Wicket project. To do this quickly, we'll use maven archetypes, already ready to use with your Maven 2 installation.

=== Create the project with Maven 2 ===

Go to your home directory (or in any directory you want to work in) and type the command below:

{{{
mvn archetype:create -DarchetypeGroupId=org.apache.wicket -DarchetypeArtifactId=wicket-archetype-quickstart -DarchetypeVersion=1.4-rc2 -DgroupId=org.odlabs -DartifactId=quickstart
}}}

You should see the following output:

{{{
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[INFO] BUILD SUCCESSFUL
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
}}}

=== Check that your Wicket project works well ===

Change to the quickstart directory.

Before adding WiQuery to this project, let's check that the created project works by typing the command below:

{{{
mvn jetty:run
}}}

Maven 2 should output some logs and the message:

{{{
[INFO] Started Jetty Server
}}} 

Then, connect to localhost:8080/quickstart. The following contents should appear:

= Install WiQuery 1.0 in your local repository =

[Downloads] the last stable release of WiQuery 1.0. When it's done, install it in your local repository with the command below:

{{{
mvn install:install-file -Dfile=/your/path/to/wiquery-1.0.jar -DgroupId=org.odlabs.wiquery -DartifactId=wiquery -Dversion=1.0-SNAPSHOT -Dpackaging=jar
}}}

*Warning: For the moment, WiQuery 1.0 is still a snapshot version, until the ALPHA version is released.*
